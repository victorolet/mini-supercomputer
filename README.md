# Mini-Supercomputer

This document explains the process of setting up and running a mini-supercomputer using 8 Raspberry Pi cluster. However it is scalable to as many Raspberry Pis as you want.
 
## Parts used to build the cluster
1. 8 x Raspberry Pi 4B
2. Cluster case (C4Labs 8 Slot Cluster Cloudlet)
3. Ethernet Switch
4. Ethernet Cables
5. 8 x PoE+ hat
6. SSD harddisk

## Installing Raspberry Pi operating system


1. Install Raspberry Pi Imager on you laptop/PC
2. Connect microSD card to you PC and start the installation process
3. Click on the “CHOOSE OS” button and select ‘Raspberry Pi OS (other) “ and then “Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit).
4. Click on the “Advanced” menu. Set the hostnames (for eg.pi1.local,...pi8.local). 
5. Enable SSH server and setup username and password
6. Save the settings and choose storage and then click on the “WRITE” button to write the operating system to the microSD card. Wait until it finishes and then eject the microSD and install it in Raspberry Pi.

Note: In a cluster, all raspberry Pis should have same version of operating system to work properly. 

## Set up the Raspberry pi

* To change password or timezone or make any other changes after installing OS
    ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
    ```

* Make sure the system time is right - The SLURM scheduler require accurate system time. Install the ntpdate package to sync the system time periodically in the background.
    ```bash
   sudo apt install ntpdate -y
    ```
In a Raspberry Pi cluster the login node should know the ip addresses of the worker node and the worker node should know the ip address of login node. So, the next step is to configure static ip address for the Raspberry pis. Follow the instructions on Static IP configuration to setup the static IP. Don't forget to take note of IP address for each Raspberry PIs.

* Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```


Then configure wireless access point

Next step is to configure the storage

Then configure the login node (same raspberry pi that is used as wireless access point)

Configure the worker nodes
