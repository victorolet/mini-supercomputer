1. To compile calc_pi.c code
    Go to the working directory
    ```bash
    mpicc -o mpi_pi calc_pi.c
    ```

2. To start interactive job session
    ```bash
    salloc --ntasks=16 --nodes=4 --ntasks-per-node=4
    ```

    Notes
    number of node - the number of raspberry pis in which we want the code to run (1-7 in an 8 cluster raspberry pi)
    ntasks-per-node - how many tasks to run parrelally within one raspberry pi. eacg raspberry pis have 4  nodes so this can be a value between 1 to 4.
    ntasks - total number of parellal tasks, which is a product of nodes * ntasks-per-node


3. To run the code 
    ```bash
    mpirun mpi_pi
    ```

4. To interactively see the code running in other nodes.
 ssh in to those nodes and type 'top' to see.
